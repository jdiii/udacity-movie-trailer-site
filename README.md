# Movie Trailer Website

## What is it?
This Udacity project displays 4 of my favorite movies.

## How do I run it?
  1. `git clone` this repo to your computer
  2. Change to the newly created directory `movie-trailer-website`
  3. In a command line window, `python entertainment_center.py`
A web browser will launch where you can view the site. Click on a movie to view its trailer.
