# Movie Trailer Website

## What is it?
This Udacity project displays 4 of my favorite movies.

## How do I run it?
  1. `git clone` this repo to your computer
  2. Change to the newly created directory `udacity-movie-trailer-website`
  3. In a command line window, do `python entertainment_center.py` (or run `entertainment_center.py` from a Python shell).

A web browser will launch where you can view the site. Click on a movie to view its trailer.
